# Galaxy-SSIM
The SSIM method developed by Wang et a. (2004) has been applied to different SDSS galaxy images to try to find active/non-AGN twins. These codes provide tools for the manipulations of the images previous to the actual SSIM index calculation and codes for the comparison itself.

 The used method has been developed by Wang et al. (2004): https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ITIP...13..600W/abstract.
 
 It has been applied using a modified version of the original _structural_similarity.py file from the skimage.metrics module (https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/main/skimage/metrics/_structural_similarity.py).
